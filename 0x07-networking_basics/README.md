Networking Fundamentals Project Overview
This assignment marked the commencement of two modules unraveling networking principles. Throughout this project, I engaged in quiz-style inquiries and scripted bash commands. The focal points encompassed understanding the OSI model, distinguishing between LAN and WAN networks, and comprehending TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

Tasks ðŸ“„
0. OSI model

0-OSI_model: Document responding to inquiries such as the definition and organization of the OSI model.
1. Types of network

1-types_of_network: Document elucidating the types of networks and their applications, ranging from local connections to broader scenarios.
2. MAC and IP address

2-MAC_and_IP_address: Document delving into the distinctions between MAC addresses and IP addresses, elucidating their roles in networking.
3. UDP and TCP

3-UDP_and_TCP: Document clarifying the characteristics of TCP and UDP protocols, distinguishing their data transfer approaches.
4. TCP and UDP ports

4-TCP_and_UDP_ports: Bash script showcasing listening ports, including details such as PID and program names.
5. Is the host on the network

5-is_the_host_on_the_network: Bash script executing ping commands on an IP address provided as an argument, repeating five times for network host verification.
